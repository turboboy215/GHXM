Driver Information
=======================================
The driver always begins at the start of a bank with several jump commands. Following this is a string in ASCII which gives information about the driver version with a date and credits. Some examples are seen below:

Early version (from GHX example ROMs, no version listed):
GHX Audio Engine (c) 1999 Martin Wodok. All rights reserved.

Another early version:
GHX Sound Engine v1026 (c) 1999 Martin Wodok. All rights reserved.

Later version (seen in Jimmy White's Cueball, Blue's Clues, and several others):
GHX Sound Engine
   Ver.00530    
(c) 2000 SHINÂ´EN
 Code: M. Wodok 
Music: M.Linzner

Prince Naseem Boxing is the only game to have a 2001 date, despite using an earlier version of the driver than other games released in 2001 (e.g. SpongeBob SquarePants and Spider-Man 2) which have a 2000 date. The most commonly reported driver versions are Ver.00530 and Ver.01206t, the latter which appears to be the latest version of the driver released. v2.0207 also has a URL to Shin'en's website, www.shinen.com. The first Tomb Raider actually has two versions of the sound data, one which uses v2.0207 and the other which uses v00218; however, it is unknown which version is used by the game. The GBS rip uses the v00218 version.

Frequency Table (Channels 1-3)
=======================================
Immediately following the code is a standard frequency table of 16-bit values. This is loaded via the following instructions:

ld hl, FreqTable
    add hl, bc
    add hl, bc
    ld c, $00

Frequency Table (Channel 4)
=======================================
This is a table for frequency values of channel 4 (noise).

Vibrato Table
=======================================
After the noise channel table is a series of values determining patterns for vibrato. Each entry is 10 bytes. The numbers are signed (e.g. FF is -1).

Sample Timer Settings
=======================================
Following this is yet another table which contains three 32-bit values relating to timer values to use during sample playback.

Bytes:
1. Timer modulo (11100000 or 11110000)
2. Timer control (0100 or 0111)
3. DAC rate (if bit 1 set, then 16khz, otherwise 8khz)
4. Playback rate for NR34 (always 87 = 256hz)

The GHX "Header"
=======================================
Following the sampler timer settings is a pointer leading to the GHX "header" which immediately is followed by the header itself. The information from the header is copied into RAM.

Bytes:
1-3 = The identifier "GHX" in ASCII
4 = Number of songs
5 = Number of rows per pattern (appears to be either 10 (16) or 20 (32))
6 = Unknown (always set to 0?)
7-8 = Pointer to song data table
9-10 = Pointer to instrument data table
11-12 = Pointer to pattern data table

Song Data Format
=======================================
Next is a pattern defining the structure of each song:

Bytes:
1 = Number of sequence (starting from 0)
2-3 = Address to starting sequence
4 = Loop point sequence relative to final sequence (e.g. 16 from 19 = pattern 3) (starting from 0)
5-6 = Address of loop point sequence


Sequence Mapping Format
=======================================
Immediately following the table is the mapping of every channel for each sequence of a song, based on the pointers for channel patterns from the table later on. Each sequence consists of 7 bytes:
1. Channel 1 mapping
2. Channel 1 transpose
3. Channel 2 mapping
4. Channel 2 transpose
5. Channel 3 mapping
6. Channel 3 transpose
7. Channel 4 mapping

Pattern Data Table Table
=======================================
As called from the header, what follows immediately is the pattern table, which consists of 16-bit pointers.

Instrument Table
=======================================
Next, also called from the header, is the instrument table, which consists of 16-bit pointers.

The Instrument Format
=======================================
Start bytes:
1 = Sweep size
2 = Speed
3 = Starting volume?

Other parameters:

00 = Do nothing for a step?
xx yy = Effect/new volume + parameters?
Cx = Sweep
8x = Arpeggio

The Pattern Format
=======================================
Each pattern is either 16 or 32 rows, depending on the information in the "header". Each "row" of the pattern for every channel is 1-3 bytes long, depending on the event.

Bytes:
00 = Empty row
01-3F = Pitch slide (e.g.: 20 = + 4)
40 x0 = Change volume (C0 = 0, 80 = less?, works from 00 to 40 on channel 3)
41-7F xx = Note/instrument
80 xF = Change speed/Ticks amount
81-BF xx = Higher notes for drums?/instrument
C0-FF xx yF = Note/instrument, Change speed/Ticks amount

Waveform Data
=======================================
The waveform data immediately follows the pattern data. These are referenced by the instruments.

TBA:
=======================================
 - Figure out the instrument format more.
 - Figure out the sound effects format.
